    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an exploration of the NHL player 2004-2018 dataset shared on Kaggle.com (generated from hockey-reference.com). The primary goal of this project is to discover whether we can group hockey teams in a meaningful way. People naturally try to classify teams into groups. For example, a plausible distinction to make is between teams that are more offensively focused from other teams that are more defensively focused. The use of such distinctions is straight-forward, with them we can formulate questions such as whether offensively focused or definsively focused teams more successful at winning championships. Answers to questions like these have potential import for decision making. This [article](https://www.thestar.com/sports/hockey/2014/05/29/in_the_nhl_defence_doesnt_actually_win_championships_hockey_analytics.html) argues that offensively focused teams are typically more successful when it comes to winning championships in hockey. They rely on goals for and goals against for a team to make their case (teams with high goals for being offensively focused and teams with few goals against being defensively focused). \n",
    "\n",
    "By doing a cluster analysis on multiple features I will investigate whether we can make a distinction between types of teams where If successful this should be an improvement on intuitive distinctions (and/or distinctions made precise using just a few features). To measure the degree of success I will get some data about which teams make the playoffs and which teams win the championship to see if the groups correlate with success and failure. This notebook represents the first iteration of this project and so is mainly a proof of concept. I will consider ways to move forward with the project if the basic framework is successful. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main steps that will be taken in this project. Since the chosen dataset is at the player level (each observation is for a player in a season), the data will first need to be rolled up to the team/season level. Then I will use k-means cluster analysis to group the team and season pairs. Finally, I will consider what if anything can be learned from the cluster analysis.\n",

    " 1. Import packages and data\n",
    " 2. Address any null values and other issues with the data\n",
    " 3. Determine which columns to aggregate and which functions to apply to them\n",
    " 4. Roll up to team level data\n",
    " 5. Verify everything looks right and fix any problems\n",
    " 6. Perform K-means clustering\n",
    " 7. Get playoff data by scraping it from hockey-reference.com\n",
    " 8. Check correlations to evaluate whether clusters are informative\n",

Also, 'Pos' gives the players position and so is not something that would make sense at the team level. The only column we will need to aggregate by counting is 'Player'. So really we just need to determine which columns to sum and which columns to average. Since we will have the player count, we could always determine the sum from the average and vice versa, so really it comes down to interpretability. Where the sum would be hard to make sense of, e.g. Age, I will use the average. "

Another reason to use different features is that there are some features not in the data above that make sense to include. The dataset used above was a conveninet option for using as a test case.

At the level of team data we are bound to find that the more successful teams score more goals on average than the less successful teams. But what we really want to know is what causes more goals to be scored. We need to dig into the player level data, and not just data about how many goals each player scored. If we can do a cluster analysis on players to categorize them then we can figure out what sorts of players make-up each team. Then we could compare the make-ups of successful teams with the make-ups of unsuccessful teams. If we can find commone differences this could go a long way toward giving us an explanation of why some teams are successful and others are not."
